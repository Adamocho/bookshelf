# bookshelf
A project for displaying read books with fancy svg animations - relies on goodreads.

## Application stack (on paper)
- react             // front-end
- node              // back-end
- express           // serving-website
- mongodb (maybe)   // database

## Origins
In the recent years I started to read A LOT, and I thought about visualising my progress on a single web page.
